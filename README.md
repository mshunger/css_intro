# Brief Introduction to Computational Social Science with Python and R

## prerequisites:
### for the python part:
- have anaconda installed on your machine (Docs for [mac](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/), [windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/), [linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/))
### for the R part:
- have R and R-Studio installed on your machine
- have the necessary packages (see packages.R) installed
## this might be helpful:
- have git working on your machine
- install the conda environment provided with this repository (because it takes some time to install!)
    - activate RISE (for jupyter slideshows): `jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix`
- EXC:
    - register with the Telegram API and have your credentials ready
    - register with the Twitter API and have your credentials ready
    - have gephi installed on your machine
